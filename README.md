# Salesengineer

This repository is my submit for the sales engineer test. This was an interesting assignment, when I opened the test file for the first realizing that I needed to use a new OS and generate financial calls with API for the first time, was overwhelming.

However, tanks to the documentation there was a clear path to take and after a while everything star falling into place and was able to create the files I’m sharing in this repository.

Thanks for the opportunity I hope to hear from you soon and continue with the process.

Tokenization: It’s a way to protect the sensible data in a card. Once you provide the information it is transform in a code (token). If anyone would intercept the code will not be able to understand the card data. 

Authorize: This is part of the two steps payment flow. In this step the payment is approved and the founds in the customer account are put on a hold, so they can’t be used somewhere else and are ready for the capture.

Capture: Once the payment is authorized the capture transfer the founds from the customer account to the acquiring bank.

Charge: This is a one step payment, like a unification of the authorize and capture processes.

Void: This cancel a payment before it is finalized. This can happen in either the authorize or charge process. 

Refund: A refund undo a transaction returning the charged amount to the customer.
